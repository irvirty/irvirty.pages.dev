# Auto theme switcher
This extension automatically sets your theme by syncing with your operating system's color scheme (dark/light mode) using the browser or following a custom time schedule.  

## Explanation:  
1. Auto mode - depends on the browser color scheme.  
2. Time mode - depending on the time.  

## Warning:  
1. Automatic mode works unstably if a dark theme is selected for day and a light theme for night.  
2. Pressing the submit button is required.  

## Recommendations:  
Use "Time" mode.
