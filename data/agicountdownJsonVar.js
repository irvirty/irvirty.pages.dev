Some estimates suggest AGI could be developed within the next few years or decades, with predictions ranging from as early as 2022 to around 2050 or later[1][5]. Notably, there is a significant difference in opinion based on geography, with Asian respondents expecting AGI in around 30 years, while North Americans anticipate it in approximately 74 years[5]. Some prominent figures in the field, like Louis Rosenberg, suggest a timeline of 2030, while others like Ray Kurzweil propose 2045, and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber estimates around 2050[5]. The consensus among AI experts is that AGI is likely to be achieved before the end of the century, with many expecting it to happen before 2060[5].\r\n\r\nCitations:\r\n[1] https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/ai-timelines\r\n[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_general_intelligence\r\n[3] https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/5121\/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence\/\r\n[4] https:\/\/sitn.hms.harvard.edu\/flash\/2017\/history-artificial-intelligence\/\r\n[5] https:\/\/research.aimultiple.com\/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing\/\r\n\r\n--- https:\/\/www.perplexity.ai\/",
