How long does it take to create a website? 
It takes from 4 weeks to 6 months to create a site. It depends on many factors, such as the complexity of the work and the technologies used for creating:
1. Work complexity: one page, many pages, landing page, e-commerce site.
2. Technologies used to create the site:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and graphic editors (creation practically from scratch).
- Templates, frameworks, stock photos, and other ready-made solutions that speed up development.
- Special website creation software or website creation platform.
- CMS and CMS templates.

Note: This is a short list of what can affect build speed; this list does not include many other things.


From research:
===
5 minutes (AI site builder platform)
few hours (blog platform, CMS)
few days - few week (CMS template)
1 week - 3 months (website builder platform).
4 weeks - 6 months (professional developer)
2 - 6 months (web design agency)

Web design notes, webdev notes (WebDevelopment notes) 
Notes:
=====
About: Notes that arise during the development process.
=====
---
 Font: I accidentally fixed the "shifting links bug" after page load (opening the link). The font loading code was originally in JavaScript, the JS was at the bottom of the page, and it probably caused the font shifting, but now I moved it to the CSS, and that fixed the problem
--
Game, UX, UI: If you create simple games like Tic Tac Toe when the Computer plays against the Player then the Computer's response should be with a time delay of 1 second, it seems more natural.
+ edit: my initial experience of playing and observing was different: I was just confused about where whose answer was, so a time delay was needed.
---
Jumping content or elements that change position during interaction is bad (UI, UX), example: "shaking fonts" or text jumping when hovering over a link. 
---
Not use "toDataURL" => use "toBlob",  because the URL too long.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL
---
"width" in CSS doesn't work with "inline" elements, <span> as an example, but "padding" works (with an overflow of other HTML elements).
---
About "em" font size and "px." If using the "em" size, it looks different, not the same on the different monitors when testing.  (Tested on two different monitors, it's a small amount, but it was enough for me.)
---
Underlining links is important! Inspired by: GitHub, WordPress. If the text color is similar to the link color, then it is impossible to see the link.
---
JS onclick: JavaScript - href vs onclick for callback function on Hyperlink - Stack Overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1070760/javascript-href-vs-onclick-for-callback-function-on-hyperlink
---
JS (JavaScript): onkeypress or keypress is deprecated, instead of this we can using keydown event https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keypress_event
---
CSS: When changing a style in a CSS file (deleting, renaming), it can break all other pages, and you will need to make changes everywhere.
---
CSS: <span> - it's an inline style element, and an inline element cannot wrap a block element (<h1>, <h2>, <h3> ...) because there will be a CSS error when we validate the style code.
HTML:
<h1><span>test</span></h1>
<h1><a href="#">test</a></h1>
html - how to mix links ( <a> tag ) and headings ( <h1> tag ) in web standard? - Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1128778/how-to-mix-links-a-tag-and-headings-h1-tag-in-web-standard
---
Using the "&" symbol is a bad idea (page validator).
---
Do not use abbreviations, no one will understand it.
---
CSS: "width" property does not work if the element is "inline" "i̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶-̶b̶l̶o̶c̶k̶".
---
Do not forget to optimize the size of the pictures.
---
If the style or page does not work, but everything is fine, you need to restart the device or computer (this happens before or after updating the browser).
---
If the style or page does not work: Ctrl+Shift+R, Ctrl+F5 or Shift+F5 - Force a hard refresh page.
---
The 404 not found page should not have a search form, most of the top sites do not.
---
Do not use emojis (emoji can have a double meaning and are difficult to read).
---
Don't use duplicate content in other place (license conflict).
---
Name uppercase (grammar).
---
Spaces in JavaScript code, because "Coding conventions (Programming style)".
---
Use standard font sizes (16px, 1em, 14px because non-standard (13.4px etc) are not suitable for CSS properties such as small, smaller).
===
About copyright.
---
If there is no copyright, then the work is copyrighted.
---
A completely free work, it is a work under a "public domain" or "CC0" license.

Responsive Web Design 
Beginning:
========

Responsive web design is a web design or CSS style that makes a website look good on any screen size.

Note: The most popular responsive design technique is "Mobile First Design".

To make the page optimized for mobile devices, first use this meta tag in the "head"
Сode:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />


CSS Responsive Design can be achieved by using:
========================================

- CSS units as percentages "%" (100%), "1fr" (for grid). "vw".
- "media query".
- CSS property: "max-width", "min-width".
- Maybe something else.


A few of my own examples of what I use:
=================================

1. If the width of the screen is 500 pixels or less, we do something, or if it is more than 500 pixels, we do something else.

@media(max-width: 500px){
p {
color: red;
}
}

@media(min-width: 500px){
p {
color: blue;
}
}

2. This CSS code prevents images from overflowing and sets the automatic size for the picture:

img {
max-width:100%;
height: auto;
display: inline-block;
}


3. My responsive content or page "wrapper" class. This wrapper in the example makes the content no wider than 560px and a width of 100% makes it adaptive to any screen:

.wrapper {
width: 100%;
max-width: 560px;
margin: 0 auto;
}


4. Hide 1 and show 2 something depending on the screen size or dynamic style change. Hide the desktop version and show the mobile version of something instead. (A drop down menu or something else):

@media(width >= 500px){
p { color: red; }
}

@media(width <= 500px){
p { color: green; }
}

or

@media(width >= 500px){
.mobileVersion { display: none; }
.desktopVersion { display: block; color: red }
}

@media(width <= 500px){
.mobileVersion { display: block; color: green; }
.desktopVersion { display: none; }
}

5. Personal experience and advice or technique:

I write CSS styles simultaneously for any screen, my method is the method of overriding the style above with the style below (hierarchy in CSS), for example, there is a regular style for large screens:

.testClass { color: red; }

Then under it I add the same CSS class and properties from the style above with values for other screens using CSS Media Queries: 

.testClass { color: red; }

@media (max-width: 500px) { 
.testClass { color: orange; }
}

@media (max-width: 300px) { 
.testClass { color: blue; }
}

@media (max-width: 100px) { 
.testClass { color: yellow; }
}

so I override the style above and create a new style with overriding method for screens that are not larger than 500 pixels, then for 200px with overwriting  , then for 100px etc

6. Note: Testing and debugging:

- Resize the browser window to see the style changes.
- Launch the developer tool in the browser through the menu and "Inspect" page and change the size of the window there.
- In developer tools, you can choose mobile phone simulation: "Responsive Design Mode" (phone icon).
- Of course, a test on a physical device.

Instruction: how to create a website (HTML file, webpage, or HTML document). 
To create an HTML page and view it, we will use your pre-installed programs, such as a text editor and a browser.

1. First step: you need to create a file "index.html" with the ".html" extension. To do this, use this instruction to enable file extensions:
Windows https://stackoverflow.com/a/71899738/22625440
MacOS https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/show-or-hide-filename-extensions-on-mac-mchlp2304/mac

Create a file: index.html

2. The second step is to place this code in an index.html file. To do this, open your index.html file in a text editor or in a code editor, copy this code, paste it into the editor, and save the changes or save file (or save as "index.html").

code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
        <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>

3. Open your index.html file in a browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari, to see the result.
